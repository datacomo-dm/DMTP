LibNcFTP Change Log:
===================

3.1.8.1, 2004-07-27
  
  + New error codes, kErrProxyDataConnectionsDisabled (-198) and
    kErrDataConnOriginatedFromBadPort (-199).  These will be helpful
    to detect when data connections were closed because of the
    allowProxyForPort or require20 fields.

  + A fix for some DNS resolution problems on Linux.


3.1.8, 2004-07-12

  + New error code, kErrRemoteSameAsLocal (-197), which is the upload
    equivalent of kErrLocalSameAsRemote (-178).  It is recommended that
    you special case this error when doing an upload, since it really
    indicates that the only reason it didn't do the upload was because
    the file was already there.

  + New "pncftp" sample program shows how to do a proxy FTP transfer
    (server-to-server direct FTP).

  + Recognize broken IBM mainframe FTP servers and work around them.

  + Working around a problem with ProFTPD 1.2.9 and later which would
    cause recursive downloads to fail.

  + For the malicious server problem that was addressed in 3.1.5, enhanced
    the fix for better compatibility with mainframe FTP servers.

  + Several HP-UX 10 compatibility bugs fixed (Thanks, Laurent FAILLIE).

  + Bug fixed with the upload socket buffer not being set (Thanks, ybobble).


3.1.7, 2004-01-07

  + Fixed a memory leak introduced in 3.1.6.

  + Fixed problem where it was assumed that daylight saving's time occurred
    at the same time each year for all timezones.
  
  + Problem fixed with "ls -a" where occasionally a row with ".." and another
    file would be omitted.
  
  + The configure script can now detect when the config.cache file has been
    improperly recycled from a machine with a different OS.
  
  + The Windows version now uses the USERPROFILE environment variable, if it
    was set, as the location of the user's home directory.

  + Recognize broken DG/UX servers and work around them.


3.1.6, 2003-08-25

  + Fixed an important bug that was causing socket leaks on Windows.

  + Fix for possible "Double Timeout" condition that could occur on uploads.

  + Added support for GCC 3.4 precompiled headers.

  + The "ABOR" sequence used by FTPAbortTransfer is more robust.

  + There is now a "canceling" field for use from a progress meter to
    determine if the canceler has been invoked.

  + There is also a "canceled" field to tell if the transfer was successfully
    aborted.

  + Bug fixed where the library would try to perror() [bad anyway] for a
    case when select() returned EINTR.

  + Bug fixed where timeouts may not have worked.

  + To the improved ASCII handling from 3.1.5, added another case where we
    workaround files sent by a buggy FTP server implementation whose
    files have CR+CR+LF end-of-lines.

  + More fixes related to the above, as well as few other fixes from
    Martin Storsj√.

  + Bug fixed where an upload filename could have been limited to 127
    characters.

  + For the malicious server problem that was addressed in 3.1.5, enhanced
    the fix for better compatibility with Serv-U and WS_FTP servers.

  + Bug fixed where a several minute delay would be incurred if you
    tried to transfer a file that did not exist.


3.1.5, 2002-10-13

  + Problem fixed where a malicious or trojaned FTP server could send back
    pathnames with directories different from the directory requested.
    For example, if you did:
      cd /pub
      get *.zip
    the malicious server could
    send back a pathname like ../../../some/other/dir/filename.here
    rather than pathnames such as filename.zip and trick NcFTP into writing
    into a different local pathname if your user privileges had permission
    to write it.

    For details, see the CERT Vulnerability Note, at
      http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/210409

 + Compatibility fixes for AIX, Linux, Mac OS X, IRIX 6.2 and SunOS 4.

 + Be less pedantic about incorrectly formatted multi-line responses.

 + For ASCII transfers, try harder to handle non-native end-of-line formats.

 + New timeval fields lastCmdStart and lastCmdFinish which are updated by
   the library automatically.  The purpose of these is to let you check
   them to see if you want to send a NOOP to keep the connection alive.


3.1.4, 2002-07-02

 + Changed declaration of FTPConfirmResumeDownloadProc and
   FTPConfirmResumeUploadProc so first parameter is a FTPCIPtr.
   Unfortunately this will require existing code be slightly revised.

 + Another internal function, Error(), has been renamed to FTPLogError()
   to avoid another namespace collision.

 + New configure flag, --disable-ccdv.

 + Makefile has "distclean" target.

 + Compatibility fixes for C++ and Linux.

 + Fixed a socket leak and a crash on Win32.

 + A few minor fixes for firewall logins.

 + By default, proxy connections for PORT are no longer allowed.  This is
   mostly an extra security precaution, to eliminate cases where someone
   could hijack a data connection by connecting to us after we issue PORT
   but before the server could connect to us.
 
 + Bug fixed in configure script for enabling Socks.

 + A few new firewalls (permutations of type 1).  (Thanks, Felix Buenemann)

 + Try harder to avoid unnecessary SIZE/MDTM/MLST/REST commands.

 + A new "hasHELP_SITE" structure field is available in case you need
   to avoid doing a "HELP SITE".  Some server software (i.e. IBM Mainframes)
   crashes when you do this.


3.1.3, 2002-03-27

 + Enhancements to Monkey.

 + Bug fixed on Solaris where a socket could be left in non-blocking mode.
 
 + Ls parsing is now more forgiving of weird /bin/ls implementations (AIX).

 + Be more lenient on broken server implementations which include extra
   blank lines in the control connection conversation.

 + Compatibility fixes for IRIX 5.x and AIX 4.2.x.

 + Compatibility fixes for Cygwin
   (Thanks, Charles Wilson <cwilson AT ece.gatech.edu>).

 + Some extra debugging information is now logged to the trace logs.

 + Fix namespace collisions with Mac OS headers.  Use "FTPLine" and
   "FTPFileInfo", in place of "Line" and "FileInfo".


3.1.2, 2002-01-30:

 + A fix for the local hostname detection code which could result with only
   the first character of the domain appended, rather than the entire domain
   (Thanks, Bernhard Sadlowski <sadlowsk AT mathematik.uni-bielefeld.de>).

 + Another bug fixed in local hostname detection where looking up the host
   by IP address was not done correctly.

 + Fixed a few portability problems on HP-UX 10.20 which were introduced
   in 3.1.0.

 + Fixed bug with readdir_r usage on Solaris, which could cause crashes
   when doing recursive uploads, among other things.

 + On Linux, use gethostbyname2_r() to specify that we only want IPv4
   addresses returned.

 + Reversing behavior from 3.1.0 where we did a shutdown() on the half
   of the socket that wasn't used.  We suspect this was causing some
   firewalls and routers to panic and assume the whole connection was
   to be closed.

 + Bug fixed where an unresolvable hostname caused a pointless connection
   attempt which would fail.

 + Bug fixed in FTPChdir3 with one-at-a-time mode.

 + Obscure bug fixed in recursive local globbing.

 + Fixes for ncftpsyncput sample program.


3.1.1, 2001-12-23:

 + Fixed bugs with our use of gethostbyname_r/addr_r on Linux.

 + Fixed bugs with our implementation of stat64() on Windows, which caused
   problems when querying information about local directories.


3.1.0, 2001-12-17:

+ Win32 support is now officially incorporated into the library.

+ The library no longer uses signals or expects you to have signal
  handlers for SIGALRM or SIGPIPE.

+ Internal changes should result in the library being more friendly
  to multi-threaded environments, although we still do not have our
  test suite ready to certify that the library is 100% threadsafe.

+ Library defaults to "PASV-but-fallback-to-PORT" mode now (i.e.
  cip->dataPortMode == kFallBackToSendPortMode).  The previous
  default had been PORT mode (cip->dataPortMode == kSendPortMode).

+ Library now uses timeouts by default since a signal handler is not
  required (kDefaultXferTimeout==600, kDefaultConnTimeout==30, and
  kDefaultCtrlTimeout==135).

+ Bug fixed where puts could delay a few seconds unnecessarily after
  the file had been sent.

+ Library optimizations should result in less unneeded code included with
  programs that use the libraries.  Your programs should be smaller as a
  result.

+ Recursive uploading has been substantially reworked for both functionality
  and reliability.  Arbitrary pathname sizes have also been removed, so
  directory trees should only be limited by available memory and stack space.

+ Huge number of lint fixes.  LibNcFTP now compiles cleanly on several
  platforms even with extra warning options enabled.

+ Large number of internal changes to the configure scripts.
